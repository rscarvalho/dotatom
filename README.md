# Atom Configuration Files

This repository is intended to hold my personal Atom configuration (located at `~/.atom`).

It aims to have as few unnecessary files as possible to reduce commit noise and leverage `apm` functionalities

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/rscarvalho/dotatom.git ~/.atom`
2. Run the setup script: `./setup restore`
3. Profit :-)

## Caveats

The only caveat I've found is that before committing you have to run `./setup backup` to update the installed packages list,
if you have installed or updated any packages.
